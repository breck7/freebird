UPDATE: FreeBird is no longer. But <a href="https://github.com/publicdomaincompany/scroll/issues/12">Scroll</a>
will be the phoenix from FreeBird's ashes and solve this problem.


# freebird

FreeBird hedges your dependency on Twitter.

1. Let's you easily export your Tweets to your own "Freebird"
static html page on a domain you control.

2. Contains a decentralized immutable registry linking
Twitter usernames to Freebird pages across the web, so that
if someone you follow is blocked by Twitter, you can still
find their Freebird page.

## Project Status

Concept.

## Origin

I went to Twitter today and found out I've been temporarily
banned. Why? It's actually pretty hilarious. Someone asked
for movie recommendations and I replied "Die Hard". I was
serious. It's a great movie. I guess their machinery got
confused, however. [0]

This was a wakeup call to me that I should hedge my
exposure to Twitter. Enter Freebird.

Freebird provides some backup decentralization for Twitter.
