FreeBird hedges your dependency on Twitter.

It:

1. Let's you export your Tweets to your own "Freebird" page
on a domain you control.
2. Provides a decentralized immutable registry linking
Twitter usernames to Freebird pages across the web, so that
if someone you follow is blocked by Twitter, you can still
find their Freebird page.

## Project Status

Concept.

## Origin

I went to Twitter today and found out I've been temporarily
banned. Why? It's actually pretty hilarious. Someone asked
for movie recommendations and I replied "Die Hard". I was
serious. It's a great movie. I guess their machinery got
confused, however. 

This was a wakeup call that one should hedge their
dependence on Twitter. Enter Freebird.

Freebird decentralizes Twitter.
